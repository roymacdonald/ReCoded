Dear Jeff:

When you asked me to prepare an article
for Plan, I set myself the task of
producing an “graphic” article which
would represent the ideas and concerns
of the Visible Language Workshop by
virtue of its form as well as its
content.

In a computer electronic age we see
print communication as a model of
changing user/maker relationships and
the workshop as a place in which the
content, quality and technology of
communication inform each other in
education, professional and research
programs.

The article “Words, Images Tools and
Ideas” would try to fulfill the 
following criteria:

1.  It would make use of the tools,
processes and technologies of graphic
arts media as directly as possible and
the tools would be integrated with
concept and product.  Many of these are
in the workshop.  In this case, they
include a heavy use of all forms of
photography and our computer graphics
system for both images and typography.

2.  The author would be the maker
contrary to the specialization mode
which makes the author of the content of
the author, the author of the form the
designer, and the author of the craft
the typographer/printer.

3.  Visual and verbal representation of
the ideas would be synthesized rather
than separate.

4.  Time would remain as fluid and
immediate as possible, leaving room for
feedback and change.

Much of the material was developed
together with Professor Ron MacNeil and
the VLW staff.  It has been a
fascinating opportunity which has
elucidated many of the complexities of
authorship into print.  There is still
no magic way - but we propose to keep
working at it.

This stands as a sketch for the future.

Best wishes,

Professor Muriel Cooper
Director
